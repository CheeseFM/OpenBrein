# IT Fundamentals
A) binary calculation including . converting numbers between arithmetic systems . drawing up and determining the 2's complement representation of a numeric value, . drawing up and determining the floating point representation of a numeric value, B) Boolean algebras including . determining what a BA is (and what is not) . in the minimal BA: 째 being able to simplify a BA expression up to its Most Simple Form 째 being able to set up the DNF (= SOP) and the CNF (= POS) 째 being able to draw up and to interpret a Veitch Karnaugh card and 째 acquiire the ability to convert a logic circuit containing logic gates to a BA expression and vice versa, C) introduction to finite fields theory including . modular arithmetic, . establish what a prime number is, . being able to see what a finite field, or Galois Field of order n is, commonly symbolised as GF(n) and . determining in GF(n) the inverse element for the addition and the inverse element for the multiplication, also in order to gain insight in the usefulness of these Galois field techniques in cyber security, D) error detecting and error correcting coding techniques such as . (a) parity bit(s) , . repetition code, . CRC and . the Hamming algorithm and E) a part of mathematical analysis, namely limited real-valued function investigation of . some polynomial functions, from the zeroth ( 0 ) to the second ( 2 ) degree, . the exponential and logarithmic function and . the absolute value, floor and ceiling function.
